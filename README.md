## Project description

This work aims at examining preferences of wine cosumers based on reviews they leave online. The project was carried out in collaboration with Ciù Ciù Tenimenti Bartolomei, Italy.


Big data has opened many new opportunities for getting insight into customer preferences.
This is also true for the wine industry, with people leaving numerous reviews online. This
paper examines useful insights into wine consumer’s preferences regarding wine taste, country
of origin and wine style. This allows producers to align their offer with trends in the wine
market, create a better profit margin and expand their customer base. The data was collected
from Twitter and Vivino web page. After it was preprocessed and a sentiment label was
assigned to it. Adequate sentiment classification of review text allowed for analyzing which
properties of wines are liked and whether sentiment towards wine can be determined using
information about its taste. The research showed that preferences towards more sweet wines
exist, but no reliable predictions about general sentiment towards wine can be made solely on
its taste components. In addition to taste, customer preferences also depend on wine origin
and wine style.
